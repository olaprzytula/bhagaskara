#### a fictional company's website

This is my first ever website created during workshops at CodersLab.
<br/>It is based on a template PSD file we received.

## Description
I tried to create the whole code by myself, not using any additional libraries if possible.
<br/>
<br/>You'll find here some scroll/click functions, sliders, a gallery with tag filters and a lightbox.
<br/>
<br/>It is also responsive without using Bootstrap and standard screen resolutions. As I wanted to try everything myself before I got help from popular frameworks, I took the desktop-first approach, scaling the site down until things started looking bad and created a breakpoint there. I'm aware of the fact that it is not the best way to create responsiveness but it taught me a lot about how RWD works.
<br/>
##### Created with
html, css, sass, javascript, jquery, flexbox

## Plugins used
##### In this project I used the help of:

- jquery.scrollTo-2.1.2 (https://plugins.jquery.com/scrollTo/)
<br/>for the sticky navbar
- jquery.localScroll-1.4.0 (https://plugins.jquery.com/localScroll/)
<br/>for content scrolling
- fancybox by fancyapps (http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/)
<br/>for the lightbox, with some modifications in its css files, mainly not to display border around photos

## Enjoy!
